Contribution Log for Zaida Le
1. Implemented the login/signup feature. In this commit, three different files were created, login.html, login.css, and signup.html. The two html pages allow a user to input data into each required text box. If the user does not already have an account, they can switch to the signup page and visa versa.

2. Implemented the tags feature. This allows for events to be catagorized by which genre of music the user is looking for. This will also be used in the profile section, where users can display which genres they are mainly interested in.
