## Login and Signup
Users and Artists can login to their accounts using the login page. This prompts the user to enter their username and password as a requirement. If the user or artist does not yet have an account, they can create one using the signup page. This page requires an email, username, and password. They are then prompted back to the login page to sign into their new account.

## Interactive Event Map
This feature offers users an interactive map that displays upcoming music events by location. Users can explore events happening in various venues, house parties, or other unconventional spaces, helping them discover nearby shows and plan attendance effectively. (could not get to this for milestone three, profile bar took all effort)

## Collaborative Gig Scheduling for Artists

## Fan-Generated Content (Not implemented because of reliance on profiles that have yet to be fully implemented)
Fans can upload photos from events and leave reviews, contributing to a community-driven atmosphere on the platform.

**Assigned to**: [Ipsita]

## Events page - Reviews 
When a single event is expanded, users can leave reviews and see all existing reviews, contributing to a community-driven atmosphere on the platform. Given that our events are currently generated with random fake data, have not yet incorporated IndexedDB; that is the next step.

**Assigned to**: Zainab and Ipsita

## Events page - RSVP (Not implemented because of reliance on profiles that have yet to be fully implemented)
When a single event is expanded, users can RSVP to the event; a little modal pops up asking for basic information such as if one is attending, how many people are in their party, and any additonal info. Again, have not incorporated IndexedDB just because profiles and events haven't been fully/properly created yet.

## Support Local Music
Users can directly support local artists by donating, purchasing merchandise, or buying tickets through the app. This feature provides financial backing for artists and promotes local talent sustainably. (We are waiting until the implementation of the profiles is finalized, so we can have seprate user interfaces for artists, and then we can implement this feature)

## Crowdsourced Venues
Users can suggest or register unique spaces to host music events, increasing the variety of event locations and encouraging creativity in venue selection. 

**Assigned to**: [Emma]

**Status**: Not Yet Implemented

**Contribution**: Emma worked on a similar feature by creating a form that allows users to register events. This feature supports both individual users and event organizers, encouraging diverse and creative event spaces. The form includes input fields for venue details like location, capacity, and type. Focus was directed toward implementing the Event Creation feature first, as it’s foundational to the platform’s functionality. The Crowdsourced Venues feature will build upon similar form-handling techniques.

## Event Creation

Users can create events by providing details such as name, description, location, time, and optional tags. This feature forms the core functionality of the platform, enabling event organizers to share and promote their shows.

**Assigned to:** [Emma]

**Status:** Implemented

**Contribution:** Emma successfully implemented the Event Creation Form, which includes the following fields:

Event Name

Description

Location

Tags

Date and Time

Image Upload (for flyers or posters)

## Music Networking Hub

**Assigned to**: Adrien

## Local Music notifications
Users can subscribe to a notification system that provides regular updates on upcoming events, artist spotlights, and local music news. (could not get to this for milestone three, profile bar took all effort)


**Assigned to**: Asher

## New Artist Showcase
This feature highlights emerging talent in the local scene, providing increased visibility for new artists for those users that want to support artists early in their career. (this feature will require more information about the users, and we don't have that yet. Thus, couldn't be implemented)
